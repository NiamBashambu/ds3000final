# Stock Market Navigation Tool

### Central Motivation:
The goal of this project is to build a tool that helps people better navigate the stock market, offering insights into price movements, sector correlations, and predictions. By leveraging historical stock market data, we aim to answer critical questions that can guide investment decisions and offer a deeper understanding of market dynamics.

The stock market plays a central role in many people's financial lives. Whether someone is a day trader, investing large sums through firms, or simply contributing to retirement funds, understanding how different sectors perform is vital for building and maintaining wealth. This tool will analyze historical data from major companies to identify trends, sector performances, and potential correlations.

### Key Objectives
1. Visualize sector performance: Track how different stocks/sectors have grown over time and identify which are showing the fastest or slowest growth.

2. Explore sector correlations: Investigate if there is a correlation between the performance of different sectors and industries, and how one sector’s movement might positively or negatively impact others.

3. Predict stock prices: Use machine learning models to predict stock prices based on historical data, testing if it’s possible to forecast stock performance with reasonable accuracy.

### Data Source
Yahoo Finance API to gather stock data and company information for the analysis.

### Key questions
1. Is there a correlation between the performance of different sectors/industries?

2. Can you reasonably predict stock prices based only on past stock data?
